# Blueprint

## Overview

This is a multi-tenant chat application with role-based access control. 

## Implemented Features

* User authentication with Firebase.
* Role-based routing.
* Super Admin, Company Admin, and Agent dashboards.
* Chat functionality with conversations and messages.
* File attachments in chat.
* User and company management for admins.
* Settings page for user profile updates.

## Current Plan

I will now debug the application and ensure it is ready for deployment. This will involve the following steps:

1.  **Fix all compilation errors.** I will go through each of the reported errors from the `npm run build` command and fix them.
2.  **Run the application.** I will start the development server to ensure the application runs without any runtime errors.
3.  **Test the application manually.** I will go through the different user roles and test the functionality of the application to ensure everything is working as expected.
4.  **Deploy to Firebase Hosting.** Once I am confident that the application is working correctly, I will deploy it to Firebase Hosting.
